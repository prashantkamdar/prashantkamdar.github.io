A small, teeny-tiny console to play simple games using a microcontroller chip.

The ATTiny85 chip is small but powerful enough for this purpose.

It has 6 programmable IO pins, 512 Bytes of memory as well as RAM and runs off of a coin cell battery!

While this might not seem like a lot, it is plenty of juice to run simple programs including games with buttons.

Step 1:
Gather the components
